Sup everyone!
Myself DracoRooks, or Rooks for short, both of which are aliases obviously.
I am currently pursuing Bachelors in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
I am proficient in C/C++ basics in-depth and have decent knowledge in full stack web development, and am at present exploring various libraries, frameworks and tech stacks.
